# Attention-based-DeepLOB-for-Prediction-in-Limit-Order-Books
Introduces a deep learning model called DeepLOB(added reference in report) with Attention. The model combines CNNs and LSTM networks to capture temporal dependencies in financial time series. Attention mechanism is added to enhance the modelâ€™s capabilities, allowing it to focus on key elements of the input data.
